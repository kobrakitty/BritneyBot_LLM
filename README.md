<br>💃Welcome to BritneyBot: Pop Star Statistician🎤📊</br>

<br>This project was a challenging experiment for me to learn how to build and deploy my first open source LLM and API solution. A chatbot (built on the personality of Britney Spears, of course) with the purpose of analyzing a simple data set, provided by the Lonely Octopus Program.</br>

<br>**Features:**</br>
<br>✨Streamlit for UI/UX and public URL</br>
<br>📢API handling via FastAPI, ngrok, and Render</br>
<br>👩‍🏫AI Chatbot via Ollama llama3:8b</br>
<br>📋Simple data analysis of a sample data set (Student Grades)</br>

<br>....✏️Instructions coming soon, either here or linked to my blog at www.glitterpile.blog.</br>
